included are all of the files in the project folder, including all of the ones pregenerated by my IDE.
compilled executable resides in bin/release

This is my implementation of the classic game sokoban.
the aim of the game is to put all of the boxes on the marked locations

The two important files are the main code and the graphics code, all other code is supporting code that is auto-generated by the development environment I use
https://sourceforge.net/projects/sharpdevelop/

use the arrow keys to move and spcae to reset the level, and restart the game
MainForm.cs is not fully commented yet.
I mainly focused on making sure the graphics was well commented in case anyone wanted to use it for their own projects.
If there are requests for it, I will fully comment and reupload the MainForm.cs
Future itterations of my graphics driver may include a variable sized output bmp.
This would be uploaded to a separate project, the link to which will be added here.
