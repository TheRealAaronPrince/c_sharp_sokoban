included are all of the files in the project folder, including all of the ones pregenerated by my IDE.
compilled executable resides in bin/release

MainForm.cs is not fully commented yet.
I mainly focused on making sure the graphics was well commented in case anyone wanted to use it for their own projects.
If there are requests for it, I will fully comment and reupload the MainForm.cs
Future itterations of my graphics driver may include a variable sized output bmp.
This would be uploaded to a separate project, the link to which will be added here.
